Steps to setup and run the program:

To setup the program, 
1. clone the repository with git clone https://github.com/rashmiagar/fee_program.git

2. rails s 

3. Go to http://localhost:300/fee






 The following JSON represents a fee structure for courses in a university.
{
"Exam Fee" :{  "INDIAN" :{
 " ALL_COURSES " :{  " ALL_LEVEL " :{
 "amount" : 400
}  } ,  }
 "FOREIGN" :{  " ALL_COURSES " :{
 " ALL_LEVEL " :{  }, }  }  "amount" : 100
 "NRI" :{  " ALL_COURSES " :{
 " ALL_LEVEL " :{  "amount" : 600 }
 } ,  }
 "SAARC" :{  " ALL_COURSES " :{
 " ALL_LEVEL " :{  }, }  }  }  "amount" : 600
 "Application Fee" :{  "INDIAN" :{
 " ALL_COURSES " :{  "UG" :{
 "amount" : 200
  
  },  "UG­DIPLOMA" :{  },  "amount" : 300
 "PG" :{
 }, }  }  "amount" : 500
 "FOREIGN" :{  " ALL_COURSES " :{
 "UG" :{
 },  "amount" : 400
 "UG­DIPLOMA" :{  },  "amount" : 400
 "PG" :{  "amount" : 700 }
}  }  }  }
Write a program using any language / framework of your choice that allows a user to determine the accurate fee to be paid based on the JSON above.
Use Case: The user  HAS to select the fee first, after selecting that, the program shows the list of associated nationalities based on the inner keys of the selected fee. Once a nationality is selected, it shows the list of courses for that fee / nationality.
Note: If an entry is  ALL_COURSES , then that needs to be substituted with the following list, and one can be chosen. Medical, Dental, Ayurveda
  
 Once the course is selected, we select the level of the course based on the previous selection.
Note: If an entry is  ALL_LEVEL , then that needs to be substituted with the following list, and one can be chosen. UG, PG, DIPLOMA, Ph.D
Once all four options are selected, the resulting fee amount is to be shown.
